## 📌 What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that allows systems to **learn from data and improve performance without being explicitly programmed**.

## 📚 Types of Machine Learning

### 1️⃣ Supervised Learning
- Works with labeled data
- Used for prediction and classification

**Examples:**
- House price prediction
- Spam email detection

**Algorithms:**
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- KNN

---

### 2️⃣ Unsupervised Learning
- Works with unlabeled data
- Finds hidden patterns

**Examples:**
- Customer segmentation
- Data grouping

**Algorithms:**
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- PCA

---

### 3️⃣ Reinforcement Learning
- Learns using rewards and penalties
- Based on trial and error

**Examples:**
- Game AI
- Self-driving cars

---

## ❓ Types of Machine Learning Problems

- **Classification** – Predict categories (Spam / Not Spam)
- **Regression** – Predict numerical values (Price, Salary)
- **Clustering** – Group similar data
- **Recommendation Systems** – Suggest products or movies
- **Anomaly Detection** – Detect fraud or unusual behavior

## 📊 Types of Data

In Data Science and Machine Learning, data is mainly divided into **Structured** and **Unstructured** data.

---

### 1️⃣ Structured Data
Structured data is **well-organized** and stored in a fixed format such as **rows and columns**.

**Characteristics:**
- Easy to store and analyze
- Stored in databases and spreadsheets
- Follows a predefined schema

**Examples:**
- Excel files
- SQL tables
- CSV files
- Customer records (ID, Name, Age, Salary)

**Usage:**
- Data analysis
- Machine learning models
- Business reports

---

### 2️⃣ Unstructured Data
Unstructured data does **not have a fixed format** and is difficult to organize.

**Characteristics:**
- No predefined structure
- Large volume of data
- Harder to analyze

**Examples:**
- Text documents
- Images
- Audio files
- Videos
- Social media posts
- Emails

**Usage:**
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Computer Vision
- Speech Recognition

---

### 🔁 Semi-Structured Data
Semi-structured data is a mix of structured and unstructured data.

**Examples:**
- JSON files
- XML files
- HTML web data
- Log files
