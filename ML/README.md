## 📚 Types of Machine Learning

### 1️⃣ Supervised Learning
- Works with labeled data
- Used for prediction and classification

**Examples:**
- House price prediction
- Spam email detection

**Algorithms:**
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- KNN

---

### 2️⃣ Unsupervised Learning
- Works with unlabeled data
- Finds hidden patterns

**Examples:**
- Customer segmentation
- Data grouping

**Algorithms:**
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- PCA

---

### 3️⃣ Reinforcement Learning
- Learns using rewards and penalties
- Based on trial and error

**Examples:**
- Game AI
- Self-driving cars

## ❓ Types of Machine Learning Problems

- **Classification** – Predict categories (Spam / Not Spam)
- **Regression** – Predict numerical values (Price, Salary)
- **Clustering** – Group similar data
- **Recommendation Systems** – Suggest products or movies
- **Anomaly Detection** – Detect fraud or unusual behavior
