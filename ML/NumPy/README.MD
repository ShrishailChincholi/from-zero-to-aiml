# 📁 NumPy Folder – What I Practiced (README.md)

This README explains **what I have done and practiced in my NumPy folder**. It describes the **concepts I worked on**, the **skills I learned**, and **why each topic is important**, without showing code examples.

---

## 📌 Overview

In this NumPy folder, I practiced the **core fundamentals of NumPy** required for numerical computing and data analysis. The focus was on understanding how NumPy handles data, performs mathematical operations, and supports efficient array-based computation.

---

## 1️⃣ Importing NumPy

I started by importing NumPy to access its numerical computation features. This step is necessary to work with arrays, mathematical functions, and statistical operations provided by NumPy.

---

## 2️⃣ Array Creation

I created NumPy arrays to understand how data is stored in the **ndarray** structure. This helped me learn the difference between Python lists and NumPy arrays in terms of performance and structure.

---

## 3️⃣ One-Dimensional (1D) Arrays

I worked with 1D arrays to represent linear data. This helped me understand indexing, sequential data handling, and basic numerical operations.

---

## 4️⃣ Two-Dimensional (2D) Arrays

I practiced 2D arrays to understand data in rows and columns. This improved my understanding of matrices, tabular data, and matrix-based computations.

---

## 5️⃣ Three-Dimensional (3D) Arrays

I explored 3D arrays to learn how multiple 2D arrays are stacked together. This is useful for advanced applications such as image data and deep learning inputs.

---

## 6️⃣ Shape of an Array

I used the shape concept to identify the structure of arrays. This helped me understand how many rows, columns, and dimensions an array contains, which is important for reshaping and matrix operations.

---

## 7️⃣ NumPy with Pandas

I learned how NumPy works as the foundation for Pandas. This helped me understand that Pandas relies on NumPy for fast numerical processing while adding labels and data analysis features.

---

## 8️⃣ Arrays of Ones

I created arrays filled with ones to understand array initialization. This is useful for default values, testing, and mathematical modeling.

---

## 9️⃣ Arrays of Zeros

I created arrays filled with zeros to learn how memory allocation and placeholders work in numerical computations.

---

## 🔟 Random Seed

I used random seed to understand reproducibility. This ensured that random number generation produces consistent results, which is important for testing and experiments.

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ Arithmetic Operations

I performed arithmetic operations on arrays to understand element-wise computation. This helped me see how NumPy efficiently processes mathematical calculations without explicit loops.

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ Maximum and Minimum Values

I worked with maximum and minimum operations to identify extreme values in datasets, which is useful in data analysis and optimization problems.

---

## 1️⃣3️⃣ Standard Deviation and Variance

I calculated standard deviation and variance to understand data spread and variability. These concepts are important for statistical analysis.

---

## 1️⃣4️⃣ Reshaping Arrays

I reshaped arrays to change their dimensions without altering data. This helped me prepare data for machine learning models and matrix operations.

---

## 1️⃣5️⃣ Transpose of an Array

I used transpose to switch rows and columns. This strengthened my understanding of matrix manipulation and linear algebra concepts.

---

## 1️⃣6️⃣ Dot Product

I performed dot product operations to understand matrix multiplication and inner products, which are essential in machine learning and scientific computing.

---

## 1️⃣7️⃣ Argmin and Argmax

I used argmin and argmax to find the index positions of minimum and maximum values. This is useful for decision-making and analysis tasks.

---

## ✅ Summary
